    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <b>industry's standard</b> dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled <em>it to make a type specimen book.</em> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <i>typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</i> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <sub>containing Lorem Ipsum</sub> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <sup>including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</sup></p>
